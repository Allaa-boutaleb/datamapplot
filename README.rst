===========
DataMapPlot
===========

Creating beautiful plots of data maps. This provides basic tools for generating presentation or publication worthy 
static plots of labelled data maps. All you need to do is label clusters of points in the data map and DataMapPlot
will take care of the rest. There are a number of options for tweaking the results, but the aim is to have something 
good-looking straight out-of-the-box.
